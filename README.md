# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithm and data structure problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and more.

I solve each problem in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, Go, JavaScript, Rust) to improve versatility and understanding. Solutions are organized by difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and include clean, readable code along with problem references.

## ðŸ’¡ Why this repo?

- To document and share my learning journey
- To provide clear, reusable solutions across languages
- To showcase problem-solving and multi-language fluency

Each problem folder may contain:

- `README.md` with the problem description/link
- Language-specific solution folders
